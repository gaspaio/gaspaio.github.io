Title: About me
Status: published

I'm an all round geek, with a strong interest in automation tools and all things *data* (statistics, machine-learning, big-data techs, etc.)

I currently work at Le Monde, France's leading daily newspaper, as Head of the software development teams.

When i’m not doing that, i’m usually either playing with automation related tools, asking random questions to data via ipython notebooks, hacking away on machine learning competitions.

I’m also a film buff ; i can talk for hours on [pre-code hollywood movies](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pre-Code_Hollywood). Well, maybe not hours, literally, but you get the idea!

You can easily find me on the web:

* As **Rodolfo Ripado** on [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com/in/rodolforipado) or [Viadeo](http://fr.viadeo.com/fr/profile/rodolfo.ripado)
* As **Gaspaio** on [Github](https://github.com/gaspaio), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/gaspaio), [Freenode](http://freenode.net/)

Feel free to email me for … well … almost anything. Just don’t ask me about the meaning of life, Monty Python already [answered that question](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JWVshkVF0SY), [twice](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2Wx230gYJw).
