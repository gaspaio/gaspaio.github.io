Title: Presentations
Status: published

I often do presentations on a variety of subjects, in a variety of settings. I usually do it to :

* share stuff I've learned
* promote practices, tools, mindsets among a selected audience

Here are the links to the latest ones I've done at Le Monde :

* **[Mieux faire parler les tests AB - Quelques outils de data-science pour améliorer les tests AB](/prez/ab/ab.slides.html)**, oct. 2015

    A very simple introduction to the statistics of AB testing. Timeboxed to 20 minutes, the goal of this presentation was to clarify the difference between a population parameter and an estimator, as well as to present the concept of a confidence interval of a parameter.

* **[A la recherche d'Evergreen](/prez/evergreen/evergreen.slides.html)**, mars 2015

    A brief study on the timeline of content at [LeMonde](http://lemonde.fr), to find the *Evergreen* content.

* **[Compte rendu du Meetup Machine Learning 2014 HS#1 : le data-Journalisme](/prez/dj/dj.slides.html)**, nov. 2014

    A brief account of the presentations I saw at a [Machine Learning Meetup in Paris](http://www.meetup.com/paris-machine-learning-applications-group/), early 2014. This was my first contact with [Syllabs](http://www.syllabs.com/), which went on to produce "robot-journalism" at Le Monde during the 2015 elections (cf. [Des robots au « Monde » pendant les élections départementales ? Oui… et non](http://makingof.blog.lemonde.fr/2015/03/23/des-robots-au-monde-pendant-les-elections-departementales-oui-et-non/)).

Quite a few older ones are available on slideshare : [My Profile on Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/rodolforipado)
