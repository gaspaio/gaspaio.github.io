Title: Presentations
Status: published

I often do presentations on a variety of subjects, in a variety of settings. I usually do it to :

* share stuff I've learned
* promote practices, tools, mindsets among a selected audience

Here are the links to the latest ones I've done at Le Monde :

* **[Mieux faire parler les tests AB - Quelques outils de data-science pour am√©liorer les tests AB](/prez/ab/ab.slides.html)**, oct. 2015

    A very simple introduction to the statistics of AB testing. Timeboxed to 20 minutes, the goal of this presentation was to clarify the difference between a population parameter and an estimator, as well as to present the concept of a confidence interval of a parameter.

* **[A la recherche d'Evergreen](/prez/evergreen/evergreen.slides.html)**, mars 2015

    A brief study on the timeline of content at [LeMonde](http://lemonde.fr), to find the *Evergreen* content.

Quite a few older ones are available on slideshare : [My Profile on Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/rodolforipado)
